My name is Omar El-Baytam, I am a computer science student from Wilfrid Laurier University! I made this website to give people a peek into what I enjoy, my little corner of the internet. :D

I was born in Lebanon and am Palestinian by blood **(Free Palestine!!)** I have been in Canada as long as I can remember and my arabic sucks to prove it. My favourite food is cheese manoushi (has many spellings)!

My hobbies consist of video games, anime, and computers, (I know, very original). As of writing this my favourite anime is Full Metal Alchemist, my story favourite game is a tie between RDR2 and Dying Light.  
  
If you are interested in my skillset or want to sign my guestbook please read my other books!
