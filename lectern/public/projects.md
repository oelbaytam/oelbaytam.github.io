**Hot and Cold**  
This is a WIP project of mine that uses a RP2040, GPS module, and a ssd1306 OLED display.  
It uses GPS coordinates to simulate a game of hot and cold, getting closer is hotter and futher is colder.  
I am hoping this project sets me up on the right track to pursue Embedded Systems in the future. I am learning a lot about electronics, communication protocols (I2C, UART), and microcontrollers.  
I am also doing my best to make it presentable so I'm refining my CAD design skills and possibly learning PCB design later on.

**Leetcode-Bot**  
Leetcode bot is a WIP discord bot written in python. It allows users to register their leetcode account into the bot for daily reminders to do a Leetcode challenge! It uses the public GraphQL API from Leetcode to check submissions from users registered in the bot. I used the requests library, sql-lite, and discord.py to create it!

**FrameMonkey**  
Frame monkey is a python and powershell application that is essentially a FFMPEG wrapper made to quickly compress videos (mainly videogame clips) to be quickly shared over social media platforms like discord, respecting the <10MB limit. This was my first collaborative project with my talented friend [Kizovani](https://github.com/Kizovani)!
